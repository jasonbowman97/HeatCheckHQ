# How to Use the NRFI Dashboard for Daily Picks

The NRFI (No Run First Inning) market is one of the most popular daily bets in baseball. The concept is simple: will either team score in the first inning? If neither team scores, NRFI cashes. If either team scores, YRFI (Yes Run First Inning) cashes.

Here's how to use HeatCheck HQ's NRFI dashboard to find the best plays each day.

## What Makes a Good NRFI Bet?

Three factors drive first-inning scoring:

1. **Starting pitcher quality** — Elite pitchers with high strikeout rates and low first-inning ERAs suppress runs
2. **Opposing lineup vs. pitcher** — How the batting order performs against this specific pitcher matters more than season averages
3. **Park factors** — Some ballparks (Coors Field, Great American Ball Park) see more first-inning scoring than others

## Reading the Dashboard

When you open the NRFI dashboard, you'll see today's MLB slate with each game listed as a card. Here's what each section tells you:

### Pitcher Matchup
Each game shows both starting pitchers with their season stats. Look for:
- **Low ERA** — Pitchers with ERAs under 3.50 are strong NRFI candidates
- **High K rate** — Strikeout pitchers reduce the chance of balls in play finding holes
- **First-inning ERA** — Some pitchers take an inning to settle in, while others are dominant from pitch one

### NRFI Probability
We calculate an NRFI probability for each game based on historical data. Games above 60% are worth investigating. Games above 70% are strong plays.

### Streak Data
The dashboard shows each pitcher's recent NRFI streak — how many consecutive games their starts have gone scoreless in the first inning. Long streaks suggest a pitcher who consistently works clean early.

## Tips for Finding Value

- **Stack aces vs. aces** — When both starters are top-tier pitchers, NRFI rates spike
- **Avoid Coors Field** — The thin air in Denver inflates scoring in every inning
- **Check the weather** — Use our Weather dashboard alongside NRFI to spot games with strong wind blowing in (suppresses scoring)
- **Early season caution** — NRFI models improve as the season progresses and sample sizes grow
- **Don't chase odds** — If a game is priced at -200 NRFI, the value may already be baked in

## Putting It All Together

The best NRFI bettors combine multiple data points:

1. Open the NRFI dashboard and sort by probability
2. Check both pitchers' first-inning ERAs and recent form
3. Cross-reference with the Weather dashboard for park conditions
4. Look for games where the data alignment is strongest — elite pitchers, pitcher-friendly parks, favorable weather
