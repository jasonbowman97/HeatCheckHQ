# Welcome to HeatCheck HQ

We built HeatCheck HQ because we were tired of paying for bloated sportsbook tools that bury useful data behind paywalls and upsells. We wanted something fast, visual, and focused on the bets that actually matter — player props, NRFI, first basket, and team matchups.

## What We Offer

HeatCheck HQ is a free sports analytics platform with **13 specialized dashboards** across three major sports:

### MLB (6 Dashboards)
- **Hot Hitters** — Find players on hitting streaks with heatmap-colored stat tables
- **Hitter vs Pitcher** — Break down every batter's history against today's starting pitcher, filtered by pitch type
- **Pitching Stats** — Season-long pitcher performance with advanced metrics
- **NRFI** — No Run First Inning probabilities based on pitcher matchups and park factors
- **Weather** — Real-time weather conditions at every ballpark, so you know when wind and temperature will affect totals
- **Trends** — Hot and cold streaks for betting thresholds

### NBA (4 Dashboards)
- **First Basket** — Tip-off win rates, first shot percentages, and starter rankings for the first basket market
- **Head-to-Head** — Season series history, team momentum, and injury reports for every matchup
- **Defense vs Position** — Which teams give up the most points, rebounds, and assists to each position
- **Trends** — Player streaks against common prop lines

### NFL (3 Dashboards)
- **Matchup** — Side-by-side team stats and game-level breakdowns
- **Defense vs Position** — Positional splits for targeting favorable matchups
- **Trends** — Weekly trend tracking for player props

## Why Free?

Most of our NBA dashboards are completely free during launch. We want bettors to try the tools, find edges, and tell their friends. Our Pro tier ($12/mo) unlocks MLB advanced dashboards and NFL matchup tools — but there's plenty of value in the free tier to get started.

## What's Next

We're actively building new features every week. Coming soon:
- Daily picks recaps with results tracking
- More educational content on how to use each dashboard
- Community features for sharing picks
